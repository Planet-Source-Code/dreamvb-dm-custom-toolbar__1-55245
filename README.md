### Description

Hi, Was sitting at my system thinking what to do. well I make a custom toolbar without using picture arrays just by using a one strip of bitmaps 16x16 and BitBlt and TransparentBlt and the Line function to make a kind of toolbar. anyway the toolbar you can add your own button click code and button up code it also has a tooltip.

I know this ant as good as the normal toolbar but it quick simple and easy. anyway I hope you beginners may find some ideas from this code to help you. Please vote if you like this code.
